        <h2>Meet the Canada Goose</h2>
        <p>
            A true symbol of Canadian wildlife, the Canada goose (<em
                >Branta canadensis</em
            >) is a majestic bird known for its distinctive black neck and white
            cheek patches. Seen gliding across lakes or migrating in V-formation
            across the sky, this species is a reminder of natureâ€™s rhythm and
            resilience.
